🏆 Cybersecurity Hackathon Scheduler
A Python-based GUI application that automates the scheduling of cybersecurity hackathon matches.
It divides teams into groups, creates matchups, and determines winners for each round (Round 1, Quarterfinals, Semifinals, and Final) in an interactive dark-themed Tkinter interface.

✨ Features
Automatic Team Management – Load teams from a teams.txt file.

Group Division – Splits teams into Group A (Top 8) and Group B (Bottom 8).

Round Scheduling – Schedules matches for Round 1, Quarterfinals, Semifinals, and Final.

Random Winner Generation – Automatically selects winners for each match.

Dark-Themed GUI – Minimalistic hacker-style dark blue interface.

Step-by-Step Windows – Each stage appears in a dedicated window for clarity.
